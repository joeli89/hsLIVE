								    I'm Joe. I'm half Chinese, half English. I grew up in England in a family of 6 children and now live in Hong Kong.
								     I have set up several projects and companies since leaving university including a mobile phone accessory franchise 
								     in Westfield, London and more recently a mining equipment trading company exporting from China to Africa. I love 
								     everything sports, fitness, tech and over the past few years, have embarked on the journey of self taught coding 
								     which I believe is what everyone should be doing! Healthy selfie combines all of my passions in one place that I
								      can keep in my pocket - this is the future of healthy living.

						        	Born into a family of 3 sisters and an erotic novelist from Trinidad for a mum, I spent the first 4 years of my career 
						        	in London and Hong Kong… working as an auditor. I recently made the decision to pursue Healthy Selfie full time and 
						        	absolutely love life as an entrepreneur! I spend 90% of my money on food, wine and the next fad health craze. I 
						        	live life on the never ending female diet train - Dukan, Atkins, 5:2, Paleo - you name it. I am by no means overweight - 
						        	I'm just permanently seeking to slim down my thighs and tone up my abs. After a busy year in 2013 getting married to 
						        	my husband Joe, going on Honeymoon and finishing with a very indulgent Christmas - I took the plunge and asked Joe to
						        	 take a snap of me in bra and pants to give me the kick up the arse I needed to get back in shape..... the photo was 
						        	 a mortifying reality shock...there were tears....and Healthy Selfie was born.

		                    <p>
		                    	After an incredibly indulgent Christmas holiday we decided our New Year's resolution would be to get back in shape. 
		                    	We thought the best way to get us motivated would be to take a photo of our body - a cruel and bitter taste of 
		                    	reality... It did not disappoint. Although we could both squeeze into the same sized jeans as pre Christmas - 
		                    	the photos highlighted the bare naked truth - we were not looking our best. More importantly, we were not 
		                    	looking healthy. Whether it was vanity, shame or embarrassment - looking at that photo was the best motivation 
		                    	we have ever had. 
		                    </p>
							<p>
								We thought what better way way to monitor our progress than to take pictures of ourselves every week to see 
								the changes in our body. The results were amazing - the scales reported no progress, but the images told a 
								totally different story. It only took a few weeks to notice some pretty dramatic changes. We have never felt 
								better in our lives (Charlotte is in better shape than her wedding day!) and as such Healthy Selfie was born. 
								It was our mission to create an app that allows you to store and share all the information and fit-spiration
								 you need to succeed throughout your fitness journey in one place. We want people to stop obsessing over the
								  scales and start tracking their bodies’ physical evolution through #healthyselfies.
