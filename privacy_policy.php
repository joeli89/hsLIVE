                                <b>Sharing of your Information with third parties</b><br>
                                We will not sell, license or rent your information to third parties without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.<br><br>
                                Any Information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set.

                                    <li>We may share your Information with third parties who help us provide the Service. Such third parties will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</li>
                                    <li>We may share your Information with third-party advertising partners for the purpose of delivering targeted advertisements, direct marketing of products and services we believe may be of interest to you (such as health and fitness) and other promotions.</li>
                                    <li>We may share anonymised data with other parties, or combine your Information with other information in a way that it is no longer directly associated with you and share that aggregated information.</li>
                                </ul>

                                Lastly, for the purposes of our business, we may provide your Information, under reasonably confidential terms, to:
                                <ul>

                                </ul>
                                Where practical we will try to ensure that third parties use and secure your Information on terms at least as strong as this Privacy Policy. However, ultimately we cannot control how third parties use information.
